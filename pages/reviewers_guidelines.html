    <h1>I. Introduction</h1>
      <p>This document summarises the procedure used for assessing Primary Articles and Communications submitted to Algerian Journal of Advanced Materials.</p>
<a name="II-Procedure"></a>
     <h1>II. Procedure</h1>
     <p>The referees' reports constitute recommendations to the appropriate Editor, who is empowered to take final action on manuscripts submitted. The Editor is responsible for all administrative and executive actions, and is empowered to accept or reject papers. It is the Editor's duty to see that, as far as possible, agreement is reached between authors and referees; although the referees may need to be consulted again concerning an author's reply to comments, further refereeing will be avoided as far as possible.</p>
     <h2>II.1. Adjudication of disagreements</h2>
     <p>If there is a notable discrepancy between the reports of the two referees, or if the difference between authors and referees cannot be resolved readily, a third referee may be appointed as adjudicator. In extreme cases, differences may be reported to the appropriate Editorial Board for resolution.</p>
     <p>When a paper is recommended for rejection, the Editor will inform the authors. Authors have the right to appeal to the Editor if they regard a decision to reject as unfair. The Editor may refer to the Editorial Boards any papers which have been recommended for acceptance by the referees, but about which the Editor is doubtful. </p>
     <h2>II.2. Anonymity</h2>
     <p>The anonymity of referees is strictly preserved from the authors, and reports should be couched in terms which do not disclose the identity of the writer. A referee should never communicate directly with an author, unless and until such action has been sanctioned by the Society, through the Editor.</p>
      <h2>II.3. Confidentiality</h2>
     <p>A referee should treat a paper received for assessment as confidential material. If a referee needs to consult colleagues to help with the review, the referee should inform them that the manuscript is confidential, and inform the Editor. Information acquired by a referee from such a paper is not available for disclosure or citation until the paper is published.</p>
          <a name="III-Policy"></a>
      <h1>III. Policy</h1>
      <p>The primary criterion for acceptance of a contribution for publication is that it must report high-quality new chemical science and make a significant contribution to its field. Papers that do not contain new experimental results may be considered for publication only if they either reinterpret or summarise known facts or results in a manner presenting an advance in materials science  knowledge. Papers in interdisciplinary areas are acceptable if the materials science content is considered satisfactory.</p>
      <p>Papers reporting results regarded as routine or trivial are not acceptable in the absence of other, desirable attributes.</p>
      <p>Although short papers are acceptable, the Society strongly discourages the fragmentation of a substantial body of work into a number of short publications; such fragmentation is likely to be grounds for rejection.</p>
      <p>The length of an article should be commensurate with its scientific content; however, authors are allowed latitude (consistent with reasonable brevity) in the form in which their work is presented. Figures and flow-charts can often save space as well as clarify complicated arguments. Certain length restrictions apply to some Communications (see Section 9.0, Communications).</p>
      <p>If a paper as a whole is judged suitable for the Journal, minor criticisms should not be unduly emphasised. It is the responsibility of the Editor to ensure the use of reasonably brief phraseology, and to assist the author to present his/her work in the most appropriate format. However, referees should not hesitate to recommend rejection of papers which appear incurably badly composed.</p>
      <p>It should be clearly understood that referees' reports are made in confidence to the Editor, at whose discretion comments will be transmitted to the author. To assist the Editor, referees are requested to indicate which comments are designed only for consideration, as distinct from those which, in the referee's view, require specific action or an adequate answer before the paper is accepted.</p>
      <p>Referees may ask for sight of supporting data not submitted for publication, or for sight of a previous paper which has been submitted but not yet published. Such requests must be made to the Editor, not directly to the author.</p>
      <p>See also the AMRS's 'Ethical Guidelines for Publication in Journals and Reviews'.</p>
      <h2>III.1. Use of Colour</h2>
      <p>The use of colour and/or half-tones is permitted in cases where genuine clarification results; referees may also be asked to advise on this [Electronic-only journals have different guidelines concerning the use of colour (see Section 10.0, Electronic-only journals)].</p>
      <h2>III.2. Titles and Summaries</h2>
      <p>Referees should comment on titles and summaries with the following points in mind.</p>
      <p>Titles of papers are used out of context by several organizations for current awareness purposes. To enable such systems to serve chemical scientists adequately, titles must be written around a sufficient number of scientific words carefully chosen to cover the important aspects of the paper.</p>
      <p>Summaries should preferably be self-contained, so that they can be understood without reference to the main text.</p>
      
         
             <a name="VI-Speed_of_Refereeing"></a>
      
      <h1>VI. Speed of Refereeing</h1>
      
       <p>The AMRS is anxious to maintain and to reduce further if possible the publication times now being achieved. In this connection, referees should submit their reports with the minimum of delay and within the specified time, or inform the Editor immediately if this is not feasible. If possible, referees should supply their reports in electronic format via the AJAM's website. In these cases, there is no need for referees to send a printed version of their report or to return the manuscript unless they are requested to do so by the Editor.</p>
 		
        <a name="V-Suggestions"></a>
      <h1>V. Suggestions of Alternative Referees</h1>
      <p>The Editor welcomes suggestions of alternative referees competent to deal with particular subject areas. Such suggestions are particularly helpful in cases where referees consider themselves ill-equipped (in terms of specialist knowledge) to deal with a specific paper, and in highly specialized or new areas of research where only a limited number of experts may be available. If, in such a case, the alternative and the original referee work in the same institution, the manuscript may be passed on directly after informing the Editor. </p>
